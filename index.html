        <h2> <span>Watermelon</span> </h2>
        <p>The watermelon is an annual that has a prostrate or climbing habit. Stems are up to 3 metres
          (10 feet) long and new growth has yellow or brown hairs. Leaves are 60 to 200 millimetres
          (2 1⁄4 to 7 3⁄4 inches) long and 40 to 150 mm (1 1⁄2 to 6 in) wide. These usually have three
          lobes which are themselves lobed or doubly lobed. Plants have both male and female flowers on
          40-millimetre-long (1 1⁄2 in) hairy stalks. These are yellow, and greenish on the back.

The watermelon is a large annual plant with long, weak, trailing or climbing stems which are five-angled
(five-sided) and up to 3 m (10 ft) long. Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs which
disappear as the plant ages. The leaves are large, coarse, hairy pinnately-lobed and alternate; they get
 stiff and rough when old. The plant has branching tendrils. The white to yellow flowers grow singly in
 the leaf axils and the corolla is white or yellow inside and greenish-yellow on the outside. The flowers
 are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on the same plant (monoecious). The male flowers
 predominate at the beginning of the season; the female flowers, which develop later, have inferior ovaries.
 The styles are united into a single column. The large fruit is a kind of modified berry called a pepo with
 a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp).[3] Wild plants have fruits up to 20 cm
 (8 in) in diameter, while cultivated varieties may exceed 60 cm (24 in). The rind of the fruit is mid- to
 dark green and usually mottled or striped, and the flesh, containing numerous pips spread throughout the
  inside, can be red or pink (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.

A bitter watermelon has become naturalized in semiarid regions of several continents, and is designated
 as a "pest plant" in parts of Western Australia where they are called "pig melon".

The species has two varieties, watermelons (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) var. lanatus) and citron melons
(Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.), originated with the erroneous synonymization
of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai and Citrullus vulgaris Schrad. by L.H. Bailey in 1930.
 Molecular data including sequences from the original collection of Thunberg and other relevant type
  material, show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) and the bitter wooly melon
  Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each other.[8] A proposal to
  conserve the name, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai, was accepted by the nomenclature
  committee and confirmed at the International Botanical Congress in 2017.</p>
